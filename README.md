# customer-segmentation
Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this project, we will make use of k-mean Clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabelled dataset. Whenever you need to find your best customer, customer segmentation is the ideal methodology. We will perform one of the most essential applications of machine learning â€“ Customer Segmentation. In this project, we will implement customer segmentation in R.
